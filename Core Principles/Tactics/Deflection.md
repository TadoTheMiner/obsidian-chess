A **deflection** is a [[Tactics|tactic]] that forces a piece away from a specific duty or square that is important. After the deflection is performed and the piece is forced **AWAY** (unlike [[Decoy|decoy]] where the piece is forced **INTO**) from the important square, another operation can be carried out that wasn't possible before.![[Deflection.png]]*Re8+ enforces Rxe8 sacrificing the rook for the queen*
