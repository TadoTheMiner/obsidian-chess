A **desperado** tactic happens in chess when a player makes one last advantageous move with a piece that cannot be saved from being captured. The falling piece can take an enemy piece or damage the position of the opponent before being captured. ![[Desperado.png]]*Instead of accepting queen trade, white plays Qxe6, which is a **desperado**. Black responds with Qxa1 which is again a **desperado**. Then, a third **desperado** is played, and the queen trade finally occurs.*
