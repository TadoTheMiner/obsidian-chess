A **Decoy** is a [[Tactics|tactic]] where you force a piece **INTO** (unlike [[Deflection|deflection]] where the piece is forced **AWAY**) a square that it doesn't want to be on. This can be used to remove a defender, lure a piece into a [[Fork|fork]] or even lure a [[King|king]] into checkmate.![[Decoy.png]]*After Rb8+, black's king is forced to leave c6 unprotected, leading to Nc6+ [[Fork|forking]] the king and queen*
