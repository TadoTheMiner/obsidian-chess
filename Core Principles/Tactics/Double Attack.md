A **double attack** happens when a single move by a player creates two simultaneous threats against their opponent. Different from the [[Fork|fork]], [[Discovered Check|discovered check]] or [[Discovered Attack|discovered attack]] (they are subsets of **double attack**), those threats can be not only a direct strike on the other player's pieces but also the creation of an even more significant attack like a checkmate.
