The **center** is consisted of these 4 squares:
1. e4
2. e5
3. d4
4. d5
Sometimes, the 12 squares surrounding them are also considered as the **center**.
# Control From Center Vs From The Corner
Whoever controls the center often, but not always, has the advantage. The main reason for this is that every piece except the [[Rooks|rook]] controls more squares the more centralized it is, thus exerting more influence over the position.
